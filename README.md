# old-school-text-adventure

## Introduction
This is the program I have created for the Codecademy CS101 Final Project.

## The Game
Some of the first computer games I ever played were text adventures. Obviously, games have changed quite alot since then, but I have fond memories of trying to figure out what to do to progress in the game.

The terminal game I have created is just a small example of what a text adventure could do.

You will enter basic commands to progress through the game. There will be items to pick up, objects to interact with and monsters to battle.

I hope you have fun.
